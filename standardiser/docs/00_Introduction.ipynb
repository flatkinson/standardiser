    "This is the first publically-released version of a tool designed to provide a simple way of standardising molecules as a prelude to _e.g._ molecular modelling exercises. A Python module is provided that performs the complete standardisation procedure; in addition, the modules that implement the individual steps may be used seperately if required, perhaps as part of a custom standardisation pipeline.\n",
